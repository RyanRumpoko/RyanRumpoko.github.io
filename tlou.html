		<div class="story">
			<p>Takes place in the year 2033, twenty years after a fungal-based, brain-altering pandemic has spread and
				infected over 60% of the world's population. Since the outbreak, the world has gone into a state of
				panic and
				frenzy as officials try to fix and keep the situation under control. When the World Health
				Organization's
				attempts to procure a vaccine fail, the United States government does away with the bureaucrats in power
				and the
				establishment of civilian government. The country is turned into a police state under the control of
				homeland
				security and the military, and cities across the nation are placed under martial law one by one.
				Survivors of
				the pandemic are assigned to designated quarantine zones that are supposed to separate them from the
				infected
				and keep them safe. <br><br> The game tells the story of survivors Joel and Ellie as they work together
				to
				survive their westward journey across what remains of the country to find a possible cure for the modern
				fungal
				plague that has nearly decimated the entire human race. </p>
